Redditwatcher 0.1
=================
By Berke Durak <berke@ouvaton.org>

Description
===========
Repeatedly follows stories appearing on the Reddit "NEW" page.
Periodically samples their scores and saves them to marshalled files,
which can later be dumped in gnuplot/R-compatible format for statistical
analysis.  Typically used to (a) see how your submission's score goes
over time or (b) to attempt to prove that a secret cabal of redditors
systematically downmods everyone else's stories.

I can do better).
